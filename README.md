# infos-coursework

My work resides in the 'courswork' folder. The rest of the code for this simple (yet still quite complicated) operating system was created for the Operating Systems course at the University of Edinburgh and all credit goes to the TAs and Profs who built it!
The assignment involved implementing a buddy scheduler to be used in the Operating System.
